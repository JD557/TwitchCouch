TwitchCouch
===========

Simple website to browse twitch.tv streams on a TV web browser.

What is it?
-----------

TwitchCouch is a simple website to allow an easier Twitch.tv browsing experience
in TV web browsers.

Why?
----

Modern TV web browsers are pretty powerful, although browsing the web with
a remote control is a painful experience.

This is especially true for Twitch.tv, where most users that wanted to see
game streams on their would need to manually type the channel url
(www.twitch.tv/channel_name/popout).

This is a cumbersome task, especially since an user needs to know the channel
name in advance (and some TVs don't allow you to easily correct typos).
